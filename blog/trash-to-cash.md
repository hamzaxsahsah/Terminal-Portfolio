## The Plastic Crisis

By 2050, our oceans could contain more plastic by weight than fish. Current statistics show:
- 15 million tonnes of plastic produced in 1964
- 311 million tonnes in 2014
- 359 million tonnes in 2018
- Expected to triple in next 3-4 decades

## Multi-Sensor AI Solution

The research introduces an innovative approach using three types of sensors:
1. Visual (VIS) sensors
2. Near-infrared (NIR) sensors
3. Far-infrared (FIR) sensors

## Blockchain Integration

The system employs blockchain technology to create a trust-based platform connecting:
- Waste segregators
- Recyclers
- Manufacturers

The blockchain platform enables:
- Transparent tracking of materials
- Quality verification
- Smart contracts
- Efficient pricing
- Supply chain optimization

    S->>B: Quality metrics
    B->>M: Verify materials
    M->>B: Place order
    B->>S: Smart contract
    S->>M: Deliver materials
    M->>B: Confirm receipt
    B->>S: Release payment
```

## Impact and Future

This innovative system achieves:
- 99% accuracy in color-based segregation
- 95-98% accuracy in plastic type segregation
- Improved trust between stakeholders
- Enhanced recycling efficiency
- Reduced environmental impact

The combination of AI and blockchain technology creates a transparent, efficient, and reliable system for plastic waste management, potentially transforming how we handle plastic waste globally.
